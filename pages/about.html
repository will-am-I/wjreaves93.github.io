			My name is William Reaves. I will be graduating from Pensacola Christian College with a Bachelor of Science degree
         in Computer Science and Software Engineering with minors in Business Technology and Web Development. In my concentration
         I focused my studies toward web development in learning the various languages invloved.

			This site is developed to give employers a look at what I have done and can do and possible hire me as an outsource.
         Websites I develop can be made using any modern scripting language, whether client- or server-side. The portfolio page
			contains programs I have worked on for work or for classes. The resume page contains a list of languages I have learned
			and practiced, skill and abilities I can perform, education, work experience, and a downloadable resume pdf.
