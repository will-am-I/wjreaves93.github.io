			My name is William Reaves. I Graduated from Pensacola Christian College with a Bachelor of Science in Computer
         Science and Software Engineering with minors in Business Technology and Web Development. While there I took courses
         in specific languages, such as Java, C, C++, HTML, PHP, and SQL, as well as courses focusing on data structures
         and algorithms, object-oriented programming, networking, operating systems, and databases.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have 4 years of experience working as a System Admin. While there I learned server maintenance, LAN networking,
         AD management, and general hardware and software troubleshooting. However, I am working toward becoming a software
         developer focusing mainly on Python, PHP, SQL, and REST and would like to head that direction.

			I am currently located in Abilene, TX, and am looking for work in the surrounding cities (i.e. Houston, Dallas, and
         Austin). You can contact me by e-mail at <a href="mailto:wjreaves93@gmail.com">wjreaves93@gmail.com</a> or by phone
         via call or text at <a href="tel:919-904-8228">(919) 904-8228</a>.
